## Additional Notes
### Genre Configuration: genres.xml

The list of genres available in the application is loaded from the XML configuration file:
src/main/resources/genres.xml

```xml
<genres>
    <genre>Fantasy</genre>
    <genre>Fiction</genre>
    <genre>Romance</genre>
    <genre>Mystery</genre>
    <genre>Biography</genre>
    <genre>Non-fiction</genre>
</genres>
```

To add a new genre (e.g., "Science"), insert a new <genre> tag inside the <genres> element:
```
<genre>Science</genre>
```
After editing the file, restart the application to apply the changes. The genre list is reloaded on startup.

### Data Storage
All book data (including favorites) is stored locally in an SQLite database file: books.db
This file is created automatically in the project root when the application runs for the first time.
