Semester project:  A Personal Book Management Application Using Java GUI and JDBC  

Short Description: 
The project will be a desktop application that allows users to manage their personal book collection. It will include a GUI built using Swing, and book data (title, author, genre, etc.) will be stored using JDBC (SQLite).  
I may also consider adding support for XML-based genre configuration and annotation-based filtering of favorite books later on.
